# Pre-release hooks
# Note: domain-check/src/main.rs uses env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION") so no replacement needed
# Note: Per-package replacements are in domain-check-lib/release.toml
#       (workspace-level replacements resolve paths per-package and fail if a file doesn't exist in every crate)

# Package release order:
# 1. domain-check-lib (library, released first in CI/CD)
# 2. domain-check (CLI, depends on library)
