# Workspace Root Cargo.toml
# 
# This file defines the domain-check workspace structure.
# The workspace contains two main crates:
# - domain-check-lib: Core library for domain availability checking
# - domain-check: CLI application that uses the library
#
# Benefits of workspace structure:
# - Shared dependencies and build cache
# - Unified version management
# - Easy cross-crate development
# - Supports both library and CLI use cases
