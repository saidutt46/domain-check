## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-28

### üöÄ Major Release: Library-First Architecture

This release transforms Domain Check from a CLI-only tool into a modern, library-first Rust ecosystem with both library and CLI components.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- **Architecture**: Restructured into workspace with `domain-check-lib` (library) + `domain-check` (CLI)
- **Crate Publishing**: Now publishes two crates - library users should depend on `domain-check-lib`
- **Minimum Rust Version**: Updated to Rust 1.70+ for latest async features

### üéâ Added
- **Library API**: Complete async library for Rust applications with `DomainChecker` struct
- **Multi-Domain Support**: CLI now accepts multiple domain arguments with smart TLD expansion
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time results display for interactive operations
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk domain checking with configurable concurrency
- **Smart Domain Expansion**: Automatic expansion of base names across specified TLDs
- **Alternative Output Modes**: Force streaming (`--streaming`) or batch (`--batch`) modes
- **Enhanced File Processing**: Improved domain file handling with comment support
- **Registry-Specific Timeouts**: Optimized timeouts per TLD registry for better performance
- **Bootstrap Discovery**: IANA bootstrap registry support for unknown TLDs (`--bootstrap`)
- **Detailed Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages with helpful tips and emojis
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced debugging with protocol-level insights (`--debug`)
- **Domain Validation**: Input validation to prevent invalid domain processing

### üîÑ Changed
- **CLI Input Model**: Now supports multiple positional domain arguments
- **TLD Argument**: Enhanced `-t/--tld` to support both comma-separated and multiple flag formats
- **Output Formatting**: Improved progress indicators and result presentation
- **Concurrency Model**: Unified concurrent processing engine for both library and CLI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with better categorization and recovery
- **Protocol Selection**: Smarter RDAP/WHOIS fallback logic with error-specific handling
- **File Format**: Enhanced domain file support with inline comments and validation

### üêõ Fixed
- **Registry Endpoints**: Updated RDAP endpoints for `.org`, `.info`, and `.io` TLDs
- **Domain Expansion**: Fixed empty string handling in TLD expansion logic
- **Invalid TLD Handling**: Unknown TLDs now return "UNKNOWN" status instead of false "TAKEN"
- **Info Extraction**: Resolved missing registrar information for non-Verisign TLDs
- **Timeout Management**: Fixed timeout issues with slower registry servers
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized memory usage for large domain lists
- **Error Propagation**: Improved error handling in concurrent operations

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **3-5x Faster**: Significant speed improvements for multi-domain operations
- **Smart Concurrency**: Registry-aware rate limiting and connection pooling
- **Reduced Latency**: Optimized RDAP request handling with connection reuse
- **Streaming Results**: Results available as they complete instead of batch-only
- **Protocol Optimization**: Faster RDAP parsing and response handling
- **Registry Tuning**: TLD-specific timeout optimizations for better success rates

### üìö Library Features
- **Async APIs**: Full async/await support with tokio integration
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time result streaming with `futures::Stream`
- **Configurable**: Extensive configuration options via `CheckConfig`
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error types with automatic fallback logic
- **Zero CLI Dependencies**: Pure library with no CLI-specific dependencies
- **Thread Safe**: Safe for use in multi-threaded applications

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- **Workspace Architecture**: Clean separation between library and CLI concerns
- **Protocol Modularity**: Isolated RDAP and WHOIS implementations
- **Registry Management**: Centralized registry mappings with easy updates
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for domain results and configuration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs.rs documentation with examples
- **Testing**: Enhanced test coverage for both library and CLI components

### üì¶ CLI Enhancements
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing CLI usage patterns continue to work
- **New Capabilities**: Multi-domain support, streaming output, enhanced file processing
- **Better UX**: Improved progress indicators, error messages, and result formatting
- **Flexible Input**: Mix of FQDNs and base names with intelligent expansion
- **Output Options**: JSON, CSV, and enhanced text formats

### üîß Developer Experience
- **Easy Integration**: Simple 3-line integration for basic domain checking
- **Extensive Examples**: Library and CLI usage examples
- **Migration Guide**: Clear upgrade path from v0.3.x
- **CI/CD Ready**: Workspace-aware CI/CD configuration
- **Modular Testing**: Separate test suites for library and CLI components

### üìã Migration Guide
**For CLI Users:**
- ‚úÖ Existing commands work unchanged
- ‚úÖ All flags and options preserved
- üÜï New multi-domain support: `domain-check example startup -t com,org`
- üÜï Enhanced file processing with better validation

**For Library Integration:**
```toml
[dependencies]
domain-check-lib = "0.4.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```
