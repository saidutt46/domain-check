//! Concurrent processing utilities for domain checking.
//!
//! This module provides utilities for managing concurrent domain checks,
//! including rate limiting, semaphore management, and result collection.
//!
//! Currently, concurrent processing is handled directly in the checker module
//! using tokio primitives. This module is reserved for future enhancements.

// Future: Implement advanced concurrent processing utilities
